# Technology we to use in Mobile Application
- Git/GitHub: A version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. And Hosting platform for software projects that use Git for version control.
- Visual Studio Code: A lightweight and powerful source code editor that supports many programming languages â€‹â€‹and provides a broad ecosystem of extensions.
- Postman: An API development tool that makes testing, documentation, and collaboration on APIs easy.
- Flutter Framework: An open-source UI development framework, developed by Google, for creating mobile applications with rich and responsive user interfaces using the Dart programming language.
- State Management - BLoC (Business Logic Component): A state management method for Flutter that separates business logic from the user interface. BLoC helps in managing application state efficiently.
- HTTP Client - Retrofit: A library for Flutter (and also Android) that simplifies the use of REST APIs. Retrofit makes it easy to create a robust and clean HTTP client by providing a high level of abstraction.
- Build Runner: A tool in Flutter/Dart that performs code generation tasks and annotation-based processing, supporting optimizations such as Assets Generator, Retrofit Generator, and integration with freezed for consistent and safe code
- Clean Architecture: A method of organizing source code that divides an application into layers (datasource, domain, presentation) to separate responsibilities and improve code readability and modularity.
